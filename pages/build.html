<h1>Building Naijav</h1>

<section>
  <p>One joy of the Naijav is that it is all Open Source. So you get to clone the repo, type in some commands and watch the App build. Sounds so awesome of course. It allows you to swap that background color you do not like with your favorite.<p>
  <p>For such reasons, dear to all of us, instructions to build the application have been made available.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Prerequisites <a name="Prerequisites" href="#Prerequisites">#</a></h2>
  <p>So what do we require to build Naijav?</p>
  <ul class="list-none">
    <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> <a href="http://ionicframework.com">Ionic</a></li>
    <li><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Ensure you have installed these requirements as we will use then in the next steps.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Download and Build <a name="Download-and-Build" href="#Download-and-Build">#</a></h2>
  <p>First, clone the Github repo.</p>
  <pre class="language-bash"><code>⇒ git clone https://github.com/forfuture-dev/naijav.git</code></pre>
  <p>Once that is finished. You need to add the platform you want to build Naijav for. Make sure you have all thre requirements met for the platform you want to build for. See ionic's documentaion on such requirements</p>
  <pre class="language-bash">
<code>⇒ ionic platform add android # for android
⇒ ionic platform add ios # for ios
⇒ ionic platform add <platform> # replace <platform> with your target platform</code></pre>
</section>

  <h2>Installation <a name="Installation" href="#Installation">#</a></h2>
  <p>Now we at the good part: <strong>Building!</strong> Now type this magical command:</p>
  <pre class="language-bash"><code>⇒ ionic build <platform> # replace <platform> with android, ios, etc.</code></pre>
