<h1>Building Naijav</h1>

<section>
  <p>One joy of the Naijav is that it is all Open Source. So you get to clone the repo, type in some commands and watch the App build. Sounds so awesome of course. It allows you to swap that background color you do not like with your favorite.<p>
  <p>For such reasons, dear to all of us, instructions to build the application have been made available.</p>
